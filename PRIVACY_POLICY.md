## S-Chain Business App: Privacy policy

###### Welcome to the S-Chain Business App for Android!

###### This is an Android app developed by Jinhao Jiang for the Anti-counterfeiting and Traceability Supply Chains project under the University of Tasmania. The app is available on Google Play.

###### As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

###### Currently, I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information, but in the future updates, it may collect your personally identifiable information. All data (like business name, ABN, password and etc.) created by you is stored on the blockchain server (On Nectar Cloud managed with UTAS accounts), user is not able to delete any data from the server.

###### If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

###### Yours sincerely,
###### Jinhao Jiang.
